# What is ShadowDiablo?

ShadowDiablo is a mod for Diablo 1 I intend on making to learn how to make a game in DevilutionX, it will contain a bunch of random different changes made purely to see if I can do them. I don't promise that this'll be good. I named it that because I can name characters and settings, but I can't name projects for jack shit, lol.

ShadowDiablo's list of possible future changes are:

-New Enemies: Slimes; there is one variant per zone planned, nothing else is really planned, I just think they'd be graphically simple to add.
-A different HUD; something Hand-drawn, I can't promise a PG-13 rating.
-New Base Items: I want to add new ring and amulet types, as well as chest pieces and shields.
-Redrawn graphics: basic items like Elixirs, potions, and other small inventory items will get different graphics hand-drawn by myself, probly.
-New class: Succubus; This is listed in the idea list as an "extreme" item as in, an Extreme volume of work needed, but I have a ton in mind for it, including a class skill that can enslave an enemy permanently to become your minion until death (won't work on Uniques)
-Upgradeable class skills
-Magic Item effects are displayed like those of a Unique Item and may roll up to 6 effects.
-Consumable item that adds its affixes to Mundane items to turn them into Magic items. Plans exist to allow this for Unique items as well, but there are no plans to allow multiple unique item affix sets on a single item, unlike magic item effects, which are planned to be stackable (not numerically, but instead adding effects to existing magic items).
-displayable in-game tile grid for those who want it, it'll be displayed between decorative objects and the floors itself with possibly options to allow players to see walkable and unwalkable space.
-A smaller Tristram; I wanna see how easy it would be to make it work, basically just make it rather small, about as small as possible really.
-Another spellbook page with new spells, also Identify added as a spell you can jsut cast yourself.
-Farnham will sell up to the last 6 items you sold.
-Gillian sells jewelry.
-Maximum stats at 999, build yourself however you want.
-New dual and triple-stat elixirs that add one in two or three stats, as well as elixirs that add multiple points to one stat. Ideally, making Elixirs drop as magic items with randomly-rolled affixes to give you permanent stats would be cool as hell. These random magic elixirs will require identification because they'll also be able to take stats away or remove 1 stat, add 1 elsewhere.
-Books act like the above Elixirs, you gotta identify them before you can tell what they'll give you. Some books are cursed.
-New Item Affixes, such as one that specifically converts the item's requirements from say... Strength into Magic, or Dexterity into Vitality.
-Pepin buys potions and scrolls of healing/mana/rejuvination; mana and rejuvination scrolls will exist, I like how scrolls of healing work vs potions of healing.
-Larger inventory; More Slots to fit more in.
-Stackable Scrolls
-Jewelry can roll spell charges identically to how staves can.

And really, a bunch more changes could get written down (like a max gold stack of 500K)
